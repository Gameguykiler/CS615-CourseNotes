Before lecture:

Other majors (especially engineering ones) have dedicated ethical societies.  Is (or are there) one(s) for Computer Science?  How active are they?

After lecture: Why is membership in these societies so low?  Should they be mentioned more in classes?  Should they attempt to have more involvement in colleges?
